# Dog-Vision-Project-using-ML-and-TensorFlow
### TOTAL DATASET TRAINED: 10,000 IMAGES OF DOGS + LABELS = 120 BREEDS <br>
### VALIDATION DATASET (AFTER FITTING/TUNING THE TRAINED MODEL) : 10,000+ IMAGES WITHOUT LABELS TO PREDICT THE BREEDS OF THE DOG <br>

The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, initially trained on 1000 dog images using a machine learning model available on TensorFlow Hub. Evaluations were conducted to assess accuracy and loss percentage.<br>

Subsequently, the model was trained on over 10,000 images. As the test dataset lacked dog breed labels, predicting these labels ensured project effectiveness and consistency.<br>

Finally, additional images were downloaded from the internet to test the model's performance on custom images, yielding an approximate accuracy of 75%, a satisfactory outcome.<br>
